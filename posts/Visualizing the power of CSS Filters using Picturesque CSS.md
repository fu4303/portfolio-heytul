Hey folks! How you doing?

I was quite busy recently focusing all my efforts into making this app work! I know the name sounds terrific, but that's actually what the app is all about.

# 🤷‍♂️ What is Picturesque.css?

Picturesque is an online tool that provides a convenient interface to visualize your images with CSS filter effects and get the corresponding CSS styles after the filters have been applied. And that's it.

## 💁‍♂️ What it's built using?

Well, it's pretty much a begginer's stack, as I wanted to use what I learnt to build something from scratch. Yes, it's good old **HTML, CSS (Sass) and JS (jQuery)**.

## 🙌 Who does it help?

Almost about anyone, starting to learn the powers of CSS Filters and also people who used to spend a lot of time earlier getting the right %'s of `brightness` or `blur` to their images!
